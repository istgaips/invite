Project INVITE (social Identity and partNership in VIrTual Environments) is a
research project on the themes of multimedia, artificial intelligence and games
financed by the UTAustin â€“ Portugal cooperation agreement (ref.
UTA-Est/MAI/0008/2009). It started on October 2010 and has duration of 36
months.

The main topic explored on the project is the development of artificial
intelligence mechanisms to create artificial players (autonomous agents) that
can perform well in complex social situations provided in games and virtual
environments. We focus on the interactions with human players, therefore, the
performance of the agents needs to be believable (i.e. agents need to display
human-like behavior). For that, agents should be able to:
</p>
1.
    Understand the different social groups in the social environment, each with
    its own interests, values, structure and identity. We will explore the
    relevance of social identity in the process of decision-making and the
    definition of self. 

2.
    Understand the game. Believability also implies rational behaviour when
    rational choices are expected. We will explore the role of rationality in
    believable agents. 

3.
    Understand the other players. Part of this implies understanding how they are
    positioned in the social groups, but it also includes building expectations
    about they strategies and plans.
