## INVITE framework

<p></p>

<h6>We present a computational research tool, the INVITE framework, which allows the configuration of a wide range of public goods experiments, in a three-dimensional environment for virtual and human participants. 
<p>The creation of a virtual world, provided by the 3D environment, where several aspects of decision framing can be explored in a controlled manner such as, for instance, the characterization (visual aspect) of participants and visual cues, enhancing the sense of presence that participants experience (due to the enhanced degree of interaction and control), aims to promote an increased level of involvement in the experiment and enticing them to act in a similar manner to a real life situation (refer to figure below).</p></h6>

Strategic games, such as the prisoner's dilemma or stag hunt, and their variants, (these structures) can be modelled or recreated in this framework, attending that it is possible to configure the information available to the participants, during the game, namely: game information, information of team and other teams, and visual cues.

<p></p>
<h6>Hence, providing more guarantees that participants are engaged in the fictional scenario and more likely to act similarly to a real life situation, this framework represents an attractive alternative to the oversimplified interfaces of the existing computational frameworks and to physical labs, given the greater control provided over the experiment.
<p>Moreover, it does not require the experimenter to know a programming language to configure an experiment, assisting him with a two-dimensional menu system for that purpose, and a set of already pre-configured templates of experiments, shipped with the framework, can be modified by the experimenter according to his particular needs, which is an improvement that greatly reduces the effort and expertise required of the experimenter.</p>

So the motivation underlying the INVITE framework is to allow researchers to be able to deploy, without difficulty, experiments where hypothesis, regarding the behaviour of individuals as well as of artificial intelligence agents and their interactions, can be tested. 
<p>The possibility to have virtual and human agents interacting in the same platform is one of the advantages of this framework. For instance, it is possible to reduce significantly the cost of experiments, with a high number of participants with virtual agents.</p>
Moreover, virtual agents also allow the experimenter to have a greater degree of control over the experiment, by configuring the behaviour of the virtual participants prior to the experiment.</p>

<p>The goal of the INVITE framework is, therefore, to stand as a usable research tool, allowing an efficient parametrization of a large spectrum of public goods experiments for virtual and human participants, in a 3D environment.</p></h6>

## INVITE game

<p></p>

<h6>All the experiments of the INVITE framework unfold in the same scenario (refer to the figures below), where individuals face the dilemma of either to contribute to the common good (construction of a raft) or to act in their own individual interest (collect a private resource), and which takes the form of a public goods game (it should be noted that, even though this framework does not support common-pool resources games directly, such games are isomorphic to the supported public goods games).

<p>The fictional scenario can be described as follows:</p></h6>


•	The experiment is set on a desert island, where participants take the role of a survivor of a plane crash. 

•	After the plane crash, the participants soon realise they must evade the island, before the eminent eruption of the island's volcano (the eruption determines the end of the game).

•	Hence, their only chance of escaping the island alive is by sailing, in handcrafted rafts, to a nearby inhabited island.

•	Participants are assigned into groups, each group having the goal of constructing a raft. 

•	In order to help build his group's raft, each participant can dedicate part of his day gathering wood. 

•	However, instead of collecting wood, the participant can decide to spend part of his time gathering a private resource, such as gold. 

•	If a group is able to build the raft prior to the end of the experiment (at the volcano's eruption), the members of the group are able to escape the island, and the raft is sold since the raft's wood is a rare and valuable resource at the destination's island. 

•	The earnings obtained from the raft are then distributed among the members of the group.

•	The game is won by the participant with the most earning, derived from individual collection and from the sale of the group's raft. 

•	Depending on the experiment configuration, members of groups which do not finish their rafts on time, may lose all their earnings. 

•	Accordingly, during the experiment, participants face the dilemma of either to contribute to the common good of the group (raft’s construction), or to contribute solely to their more individualistic goal (private resource's collection).

<p></p>
<h6>Before playing the game, each participant took personality tests, provided demographic information and rated their experience with digital technologies.The participants played the game with human or artificial collaborators without fully knowing who exactly they were playing with, and did so in conditions that affected social identification with one's team (e.g., using avatars wearing the participants' University color or not).
<p></p>
After playing the game, participants provided information about the experience. In-game behaviors were also measured.</h6>
