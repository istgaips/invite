</br>
</span></img>
</span>

Has built and now co-founded a Massive Multiplayer Online Browser Game called Almansur <http://www.almansur.net> with some friends.
Since that inception has largely left the enterprise world behind and drunk the startup spirit kool-aid, started a large evangelization on his day job company @ <http://www.pdmfc.com> to get everybody up to speed with the lastest piece of tech. 
Since 2005 has been pushing for Ruby On Rails, Git, Coffescript, JQuery (the list seams to go on forever) and lean development techniques as a replacement for the old arts our company used to built upon.
As a technical evangelist his day job gets him to explore all kinds of cool stuff, from building and SMS gateway in mirah <http://www.mirah.org> for android, testing jruby head and Openjdk 1.7 invokedynamic patches to extract every once of performance from our game engine, integrating RoR apps into a Liferay corporate portal and seamlessly integrate them through SSO.
More recently, has been focused on improving web applications to leverage on the HTML5 goodies, exploring canvas, offline storage, javascript frameworks (underscore.js, backbone.js, sproutcore) along the way, this normally includes sleepless nights debugging some weird edge case on some weird browser (read IE9) and trying to get performance up to a reasonable level. 
Though ruby continues to be a great love affair, finds himself slipping into scala or golang more often when in need of good performance or for highly concurrent apps.
